#+TITLE: Python Book API

This is a 'toy' repository as I complete [[https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask#lesson-goals][Creating Web APIs with Python and Flask]]. I may deviate from that tutorial, but that is my starting point. 

* Run
#+begin_src bash :subprocess
python server.py
#+end_src

* Get the database
#+begin_src bash
if [ ! -e "books.db" ]; then 
    curl -o books.db \
         "https://programminghistorian.org/assets/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask/books.db"
fi
#+end_src
